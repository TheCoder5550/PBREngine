# How to tune the cars

## Easier 360s
Can't do 360 entries? Try tuning these:
1. Increase max steer angle (>= 70deg)
1. How the wheels are pointed during the 360 is important. Disable steering assist or tune it.
1. Increase max engine torque so the wheels can spin during the whole maneuver
1. (Increase moment of inertia around up-axis to allow the car to keep momentum)

## Spinning out when drifting
1. Enable steering assist
1. Increase max steer angle
1. Practice drifting
